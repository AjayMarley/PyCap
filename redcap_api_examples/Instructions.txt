REDCap API Examples

1.) Place all the PHP files included here in a web-accessible directory on a web server 
running PHP.
2.) Modify any of the PHP files (except RestCallRequest.php) as needed to conform to 
the API token, URL, and other values that you wish to set for your API request(s).
3.) Once you have modified the files, you can then access them via a web browser in 
order to send the API request (e.g. https://www.example.com/export_records.php).

NOTE: These example files require the PHP cURL library to be installed on the web server 
on which these files are hosted.
